# Routing Table Simulation

Simulation writted in Python to simulate the routing of random packets (RandomPackets.txt) based on a specified routing table (RoutingTable.txt). Output is a log of how each packet has been handled (RoutingOutput.txt). 

## Try it out!:
- delete RoutingOutput.txt 
- run main.py 

Test it with your own packets and table spec!
